description: How company ranks work in Nebula
---

When you first fly for a company in Nebula, you do so as a `Flight officer`, the lowest rank for any company. As you fly more and more with them, you will be eventually promoted.

Ranks for all companies you have ever flown are displayed on your profile, and you can check your current rank with a company by visiting their main page.

## Rank restricted assignments

Some assignments will require that you have a particular rank or number of hours with the company. You will not be able to accept those when you are below the requirements.

To access those assignments you will need to fly more with that partcular company until you get promoted or meet the requirements

### Rank or minimum hours

Assignments can be locked behind:

- Rank
- Minimum number of hours

That means that some companies will ask you to flight a few simple assignments to check you are capable to doing the job before allowing you get into their meat and potatoes (e.g. minimum 5 hours with them), while others will lock certain assignments to `Captains` or higher ranks.
