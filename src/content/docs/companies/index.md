description: What are companies in Nebula
---

In Nebula companies are entities that generate assignments at certain locations where they operate. They can be system owned or player-owned (in the future!).

Currently all companies are system owned.

## Types of assigments

Not all companies operate the same kind of business! Some will specialise in small cargo flights, while others would do long VIP passenger flights, or regional passenger operations. It's up to you whether you stick with one because you like their type of assignments, or you flight for multiple companies.

There is no limit on how many companies you flight with at the same time.

## Where can I find companies assignments?

Companies will run flights from any of their bases (think about it as their FBOs). You can go to `Companies > {Company name}` to view their bases, from there click on the airport ICAO code and you'll see any flights operated from the companies based at that airport.
