title: Running the Omega client
description: Tracking and reporting your flights
---

The Omega client is a Windows-only application that needs to be installed on the same machine as MSFS in order to track your flights and ensure they match the assignments.

You can not run the client on a network machine. Currently there are no plans to do this.

## Requirements

- A machine with MSFS installed
- Simconnect

## Connecting to MSFS

The app should connect automatically once MSFS is ready. If you have any trouble connecting, close the app and run it once MSFS is running.
