title: Running the Nebula client
description: Tracking and reporting your flights
---

The Nebula client is a Windows-only application that needs to be installed on the same machine as MSFS in order to track your flights and ensure they match the assignments.

You can not run the client on a network machine. Currently there are no plans to do this.

## Requirements

- A machine with MSFS installed
- Simconnect

## Connecting to MSFS

- Launch MSFS
- Once MSFS is running, launch the Nebula client, the app should connect automatically to MSFS
- Log in using the same details as the website
- If you have a plane and/or assignment booked, it will appear on the client, along with the information of your currently loaded plane

If you have any trouble connecting, close the app and run it once MSFS is running.
