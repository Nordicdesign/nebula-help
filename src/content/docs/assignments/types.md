description: Different types of assignments in Nebula
---

There are different types of assignments in Nebula, but broadly they are grouped by:

- Company
- General
- Player generated (in roadmap)

## Company assignments

On airports that have a company base (FBO), that company will release assignments for the captains to pick up and complete. To view them visit an airport and you will see them listed under the company name.

Notice that many assignments show the name of an aircraft with them. That means the company provides the plane and you only have to fly it. You don't have to worry about rental or fuel costs, but you do **have to fly with that plane**, otherwise the company won't be happy and will reject your flight.

### Company ranks

Some assignments (normally bigger / higher paying) will only available to captains that have reached a certain level of reputation with that company. To increase your reputation, you'll need to fly more for them.

You can see your reputation with each company by visiting the `Companies` section.

## General assignments

Every airport in the world will have _general_ assignments, those are jobs the people in the area need done. It could be charter flights, transporting some cargo, etc. You will have to provide your own plane (leased or owned outright) in order to accept those jobs.

## Player generated assignments (roadmap)

This feature is still in scoping phase but the idea is that captains will be able to create a company, rent or buy space at airports (FBO) and generate their own assignments, either to be flown by them or open to everybody. This is generate revenue to the owners of that company.
