There are different types of assignments in Omega, but broadly they are grouped by:

- Company assignments
- System generated

## Company assignments

On airports that have a company base (FBO), that company will release assignments for the captains to pick up and complete. To view them visit an airport and you will see them listed under the company name.

Notice that many assignments show the name of an aircraft with them. That means the company provides the plane and you only have to fly it. You don't have to worry about rental or fuel costs, but you do **have to fly with that plane**, otherwise the company won't be happy and will reject your flight.

## System assignments

Every airport in the world will have _system_ assignments, those are jobs the people in the area need done. It could be charter flights, transporting some cargo, etc. You will have to provide your own plane (leased or owned outright) in order to accept those jobs.
