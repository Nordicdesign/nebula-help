title: Getting started with Nebula
description: What is Nebula?
---

Nebula is a career / economy simulation for flight simation, currently supporting MS Flight Simulator. You can flight all over the world running assignments and getting paid (virtually) in the process.

**Nebula is in active development, early access.**

## What can I do now?

- Be a bush pilot. Lease or buy your own plane and visit the world, all airports have assignments of different sizes that will allow you to earn (virtual) money
- Make a career. Companies around the world are looking for pilots for hire. Fly their assignments and increase your wallet. No need to own a plane
- Setup a finance or leasing company. Fund others get their dream hangar

### What's coming in the future?

- Build your own empire. Create a company, setup routes, and slowly acquire new licenses and FBO to fly new type ratings to new places

## Simulators supported

**Only MSFS (MS Flight Simulator 2020) is currently supported**. MSFS 2024, P3D and FSX _should_ probably work but it has been not been tested.

We may support X-Plane 12 in the future, but have not started development of the client yet.

Nebula FS has no relationship with Microsoft or Asobo.

## General how it works

- Obviosuly you'll first need to create an account (it's free!) in order to access the service
- You will need to install the client (Volando) on your MSFS machine. This tracks your MSFS flights and matches it with the assignments on the website

#### Each flight

The genereral gist of the system is to find assignments on the website that you want to flight, book the one you want to flight, load that particular plane and airport, and use the client ot track the flight, so we know that you have completed the assignment.

- Go to the website and find a company assignment that has a plane attached to it
- Load MSFS, head to that airport, and conduct the flight

There are two types of assignments, [read more about them here](/assignments/types/).
