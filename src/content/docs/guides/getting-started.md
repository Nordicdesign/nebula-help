title: Getting started with Nebula
description: What is Nebula?
---

Nebula is a career / economy simulation for flight simation, currently supporting MS Flight Simulator. You can flight all over the world running assignments and getting paid (virtually) in the process.

## What can I do?

- Fly assignments for companies from many airports all over the world, gaining ranks in the process
- Lease your own plane
- Pick up assignments from _any_ airport in MSFS with your own plane

## Simulators supported

**Only MSFS (MS Flight Simulator 2020) is currently supported**. FSX _should_ probably work but has been not been tested.

We plan to support X-Plane in the future, but have not started development of the client yet.

Nebula has no relationship with Microsoft or Asobo.

## General how it works

#### One time only

- Obviosuly you'll first need to create an account (it's free!) in order to access the service
- You will need to install the client on your MSFS machine. This tracks your MSFS flights and matches it with the assignments on the website

#### Each flight

The genereral gist of the system is to find assignments on the website that you want to flight, book the one you want to flight, load that particular plane and airport, and use the client ot track the flight, so we know that you have completed the assignment.

- Go to the website and find a company assignment that has a plane attached to it
- Load MSFS, head to that airport, and conduct the flight

There are two types of assignments, [read more about them here](/assignments/types/).

### Other functionality in the roadmap

Listed in no particular order:

- X-Plane support
- Create and run your own companies, including renting or buying space at airports (FBOs)
- Buy/sell planes in the marketplace from/to other captains
- Lease planes to other captains
- Having your own hangar
