description: First steps to get to the air in Omega.

Omega is a career / economy simulation for flight simation, currently supporting MS Flight Simulator. You can flight all over the world running assignments and getting paid (virtually) in the process.

## What can I do?

- Fly assignments for companies from many airports all over the world
- Buy or lease your own plane (future)
- Pick up assignments from _any_ airport in MSFS with your own plane

### Other functionality in the roadmap

Listed in no particular order:

- X-Plane support
- Create your own companies
- Buy/sell planes in the marketplace from other captains
- Lease planes to other captains

## Simulators supported

**Only MSFS (MS Flight Simulator 2020) is currently supported**. FSX _could_ probably work but has been not been tested.

We plan to support X-Plane in the future, but have not started development of the client yet.

Omega has no relationship with Microsoft or Asobo.
