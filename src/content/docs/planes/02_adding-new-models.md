description: How to get new planes into Nebula
---

The current list of planes available in Nebula is very limited, to simplify testing. But if you rather use a different model please let us know!

## Information needed

We will need the following information, that you can send us on Discord. See below the example for MSFS's default Bonanza A36.

**All fuel, cargo and plane weight values in pounds (lbs)**

```
name: 'Beechcraft Bonanza A36',
seats: 5, // do not include the pilot(s)
cargo: 60, // lbs
totalFuel: 80, // lbs
emptyWeight: 1148, // lbs
mtow: 1765, // lbs
engines: 1, // number of engines
typeEngines: 'piston', // could be piston, turboprop, jet...
atcModel: 'TT:ATCCOM.AC_MODEL_BE36.0.text',

```
