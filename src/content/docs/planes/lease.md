There are multiple ways of getting your own plane, with system leasing being the most accessible. No commitments, no long contracts and low barrier to entry.

## What is a lease exactly

A system lease is a monthly rolling contract where you get a plane owned by the system, to use it as if it was your own. It renews automatically and there are no penalties for cancelling it. It's probably the most expensive way of owning a plane, but also the easiest.

### Key aspects

- All leases last until the end of the month
- Leases renew automatically
- Leases can be cancelled at any time. This will terminate the lease immediatelly and you will lose access to the place.
- The system will not refund you any money when you cancel a lease

### How to lease a plane

Other players may offer personal leases in the future. We do not cover these options here, and you will have to ask them for their terms and conditions.
