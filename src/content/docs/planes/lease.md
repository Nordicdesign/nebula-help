description: How to get your own plane

There are multiple ways of getting your own plane, with system leasing being the most accessible. No commitments, no long contracts and low barrier to entry.

## What is a lease exactly

A system lease is a monthly rolling contract where you get a plane owned by the system, to use it as if it was your own. It renews automatically and there are no penalties for cancelling it. It's probably the most expensive way of owning a plane, but also the easiest.

### Key aspects

- First payment to take the lease will be of the proportional amount of the remaining of the month
  - For example: If you take a lease on the 15th, your first payment will roughly be half of the normal amount
- All leases last until the end of the month
- Leases renew automatically on the 1st of the month
- Leases can be cancelled at any time. This will terminate the lease immediatelly and you will lose access to the place.
- The system will not refund you any money when you cancel a lease
  - For example: You renew a lease on the 1st of March, and decide to cancel on the 2nd. The plane will stop being available for you immediately, and the system will not return you any money, despite you have paid until the end of March

## Viewing your planes

Visit your hangar to view your plane. It'll be ready to fly from the airport where the dealership you leased is based. You are ready to fly wherever you want! You can use your plane to run company assignments, or general ones that are available at _all_ airports.

## Other ways of leasing planes

In the future other players will be able to offer personal leases. Once that's available, you will have to ask them for their terms and conditions.
