description: Where can you fly in Nebula

The database currently contains 23,000+ airports, from a quite up to date real world source (not MSFS).

That means there may be some discrepancy with your simulator. Some may be missing (think small jungle strips), have the wrong name, etc. Expect this mainly on small airports.

### Can the database be updated?

**Yes.** It is constanty changed.

With so many airports, many of them have the incorrect size and require changes. Plus work will be needed when X-Plane is supported.

If you see something that is not right, let us know and we'll change it.

### Airports categories

There are 5 categories of airports, based on their size / type of operations. You can roughly group them by:

- Size 5: Only the biggest international airports
- Size 4: Big airports, but not the busiest on each country
- Size 3: Mix of occasional international no-frills flights with cheap airlines, regional and local GA traffic, etc. The classic low cost 737/320 flight won't operate at anything smaller than a size 3 airport
- Size 2: Busy, decent size airfield
- Size 1: Tiny airstrips, grass fields, etc.

As you can imagine we can't know the correct size of each one of the 23,000+ airports in the Nebula world, so we expect many to be wrong. If you see something that is game breaking (e.g. a small grass patch marked as size 5 international airport) please let us know and we'll update it.

Not all companies will operate at all airports. Some may focus on size 4 & 5, others on small airfields.
